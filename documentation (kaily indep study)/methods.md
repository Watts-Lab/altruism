Our study aimed to explore pro-social behavior among workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform within a controlled yet ecologically valid setting. Specifically, we sought to understand decision-making processes and pro-social tendencies of workers when engaging with a pool of HITs that appeared to be sourced from one another

We recruited participants for our experiment in two ways. The first group of workers, whom we referred to as the sharers, were invited to join our study and complete a set of HITs comprising various surveys and popular crowd-sourcing tasks. After accepting this work, the sharers received a share code that they could use to invite other workers into the study. The workers who joined the experiment through this method were considered receivers.

Our experimental design maintained the integrity of the environment, allowing us to observe and analyze participant interactions, decision-making processes, and task completion dynamics within a controlled framework. Firstly, we parameterized conditions to explore the impact of sharing. Our design allowed us to manipulate the costs of completing each HIT by explicitly altering the monetary reward for each completed HIT and adjusting the difficulty of tasks. This malleability in task design allowed us to capture more insights into participants' decision-making processes when determining whether or not to share work with other Mechanical Turk workers.

Moreover, our dynamic system randomly assigned sharers into two experimental conditions—costless or costful—once they opted into the experiment. In the costless treatment, participants could invite workers without facing a penalty. In this condition, receivers were assigned a set of HITs independent of other work and workers on the platform. In the second treatment, receivers who opted into the experiment also received a collection of HITs to complete. However, we placed these receivers into a network that included the sharer and all other workers who joined the experiment via the sharer. Each HIT completed by a worker in this network dynamically responded to the number of HITs for the remaining participants in the group. Specifically, when a participant completed a HIT in this network, it reduced the total remaining HITs for every other player by one.

Crucially, this system allowed us to control how many HITs every participant could complete while maintaining ecological validity. Participants viewed all work as being conducted on the established Mechanical Turk platform, and HITs followed the standard process of generation and expiration. However, we maintained control over how many HITs each participant could complete and could intervene if necessary. Our design ensured transparency about the experiment dynamics, aiming to mitigate frustrations within the worker community.
